- 👀 I’m interested in web- and system development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning webdevlopment with php, MySQL, JavaScript, WordPress, Drupal and system development with C# and much more
- 💞️ I’m currently looking for an internship prefarably located in the Malmö/Skåne area. I would especially like to learn more about C#/.NET development to practice what I've been learning during my education as a programmer from Lexicon (2021). But I am also open to frontend and backend internship within html, css and php programming/styling for WordPress, Drupal, Magento and other things you might need.
